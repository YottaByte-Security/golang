RenameNeatFiles
===============
///

This code renames files created by the Neat scanner software to yyyymmdd ($xxxx.xx) Name

First commit included initial operating capability, input checking and error checking.

Program handles complete date, amount and name information only.
Next iteration needs to address situations where one or more of the above information is missing.
Third iteration needs to move the resulting file into the already existing file tree.
